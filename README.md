# üçø React Movie

##### React Movie is a ReactJS App that uses M=the MovieDB API with Styled Components, Prop Types Validation and Cypress Test Suite (coming soon..).
##### You can view the project [here](https://react-search-movie-db.netlify.app/).

## User Journey
1. User lands on homepage, popular films are already displayed.
2. User can search for any film, with the results being displayed.
3. User can then click on the movie they want to find out more information about.
4. The information includes revenue, budget and directors and displays a list of the actors.
5. User can also select on an actor and be taken to their bio page.

## User Journey No. 2
1. User lands on homepage, popular films are already displayed.
2. User log into movie db with a guest account, with redirect to movieDB and back again.
3. This enables the user to be able to do all functionality above, but also rate a movie.


## Future Features & Improvements
* Test coverage over the app, using sypress or another testing framework **Testing**.
* Rework the guest user sign in flow as poor UX/UI.

Thanks.
